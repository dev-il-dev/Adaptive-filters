# Adaptive-filters
Adaptive filtering is a vast area of research in the Present decade for communication researchers. Adaptive noise cancellation is an approach used for noise reduction in the speech signal. As the received signal is continuously corrupted by noise, both received signal and noise signal change continually, thus raising the need for adaptive filtering. This report deals with noise cancellation in speech signals using Adaptive noise cancellation.
